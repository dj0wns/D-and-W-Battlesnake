Order of things to do based on value:
  1. Add food to Evaluator
  2. Simulate other snakes when evaluating new positions
  3. Add benchmarking to keep track of how long our algorithm takes from start to finish
  4. Increase depth of new positions scanning (alpha-beta pruning?) - Try with depth of 2 first, exhaustive search.
  5. Implement variable depth to take full advantage of our compute time. 



Good moves:
  - Look into punishing other snakes?
  - When is moving onto another snakes head relevant/how to quantify?
  - Increase depth to evaluator
  - Look into killing other small snakes if the area evaluation makes sense. 
  - We need something to handle when 2 heads cover the same tile? (Maybe solve this with the simulate board logic to remove the other snake)

Adding Food to the evaluator:

Goals
 - If health is equal to the distance to the closest food we 100% have to go for it
  - If we are exceedingly low health, we would want to leave early to have more wiggle room, prevent starvation
  - Move towards it even if we still have a lot of time. 
  - Look into food spawning algorithm - maybe distance to food vs probability of food spawning in areas we control is higher than that of the nearest food as a parameter to make that decision.

Idea 1: Put little emphasis food unless needed - keep as much focus as possible on board control, effectively ignore food unless absolutely needed
  Pros:
    - Keep strong control of the board
  Cons:
    - We will almost always be the smallest snake on the board
      - Reduces the pressure we are able to exert on other snakes
    - A smart snake could theoretically starve us out.
    - May fail in the super late game when there arent many free squares

Idea 2: Give food a constant weight so if we are close we will always pick it up:
  Pros:
    - We will in general have a larger size
  Cons:
    - We are sacrificing area


Idea 1 approaches:
  1. Sliding Scale, food starts low in value and increases according to some function (linearly, quadratically)
    - Want food to be appealing to grab but only when it concedes as little area as possible unless its needed
  2. Ignore food completely unless under a threshold and then be hungry hungry hippo
    - Is getting food over 60 stamina even relevant??
